# üî® Refactor the code

## Assignment in work methodology (Arbetsmetodik)
This was an assignment for the course Arbetsmetodik as part of my education (Frontend developer) at Medieinstitutet.

## üìú Setup
We were asked to take one our previous projects and refactor the code based on code smells and best practices.

### Log of changes

#### Conventional commits
During this assignment I chose to use conventional commits to practice writing more meaningful commits that are more clear and concise. I was thinking of using the gitmoji method but since I hadn¬¥t used it before I and we only had a week I decided to stick with convetional commits.
 
#### üñåÔ∏è Sass

Since the project I chose to refactor is an old group project and a project we did a while ago the SCSS we originally wrote is a bit messy.
I decided to rewrite big parts of the code to have a more coherent naming convetion and follow the BEM method.

#### üñåÔ∏è Stylelint

I chose to use stylelint to conform my SCSS to the standards of modern SCSS-writing.

#### ‚ú® ESLint & Prettier

I used ESLint & Prettier on all the code to conform to modern standards and keep the code as easy to read as possible.

#### üßπ Code cleanup
As we originally wrote the code we wrote a lot of comments to communicate our different choices. Since then I have learned to write better code that is more easily read and cleaner in general and so I have decided to clean out a lot of the old comments and messy code in general.
